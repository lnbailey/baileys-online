    <p>Mary E. Slemp was born in Big Stone Gap, VA. She is known by many as Mother Mary, due to her taking in of strays and
        general goodness of her heart. She worked at Eastmas Kodak (now TN Eastman Co) in Kingsport until she married our
        dad. She started having babies and didn't know how to stop (LOL). She is the best mom you could ever ask for.

    <p>Wayne Alan Bailey was born in OK when our parents were stationed there. He was known by his cycle friends as Wayne Chung.
        He was a master carpenter and restored vintage bicycles and loved to restore or build Honda motorcycles. He was also
        a great guitar and bass player. We lost him in 2015 but he is one of those people you could never forget. A true
        one-of-a-kind. The world just isn't that same without him.
